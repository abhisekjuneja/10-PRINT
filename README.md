# Coding-Challenges
This repository contains the source code for a bunch of Coding Challenges that I've attempted in order to challenge myself. I was inspired [this post](https://www.raywenderlich.com/135789/how-to-be-a-better-developer-with-programming-challenges) on www.raywenderlich.com to take this project up as a way of expanding my Knowledge of Writing Good Code and in that process learn new stuff and possibly innovate.

> To be the best developer you can be, you want to build your muscle memory. You should look outside your comfort zone and work with unfamiliar tools and problems. Thatâ€™s what programming challenges are all about!
