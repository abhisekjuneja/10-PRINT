# PONG#

A clone of the [Original Atari Title - Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) built with nostalgia and ‚ù§ using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/).

#### Inspiration

This project was inspired by the website [PongGame.org](http://www.ponggame.org/) which has a large collection of Pong Game Clones written by enthusiasts. It even has a [3D version](http://www.ponggame.org/3dpong.php) of the game and I highly recommend checking it out!

The problem with this website that it employs the use of Adobe's Flash Player to run the game in the browser. Although Flash is a great web technology, its not supported by common browsers on mobile devices. This inspired me to create my own version of the game in JavaScript using p5-js. 

I know that there are ton of implementations of this game in many different languages and frameworks. However, I believe in **creating** and not **consuming**, so this is my own little piece. 

***Warning:*** The code underneat might be horrible for seasoned game developers. But as long as it works well without any glitches, I'm okay with it!

#### Dependencies

- **[P5-JS](https://p5js.org/)**: p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of <a href = "[http://processing.org](http://processing.org/)">Processing</a>, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.
- [**Bootstrap**](http://getbootstrap.com/): Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.

#### Features

- The canvas is responsive in nature which allows you to resize the browser window to match your preffered viewing size
- Game Information (Player Names, Final Score, Date-Time Stamp) is pushed to a remote database and the recent top scoring game-play information is updated in real time.  

#### Key-Map

*Player 1 - Up/Down*: `W / S`

*Player 2 - Up/Down*: `Up-Arrow / Down-Arrow`

Play/Pause - `Spacebar`

#### Future Improvements

I *really*, *really* want to integrate **AI** into the game, allowing users to interact with the game in 

`Human v/s AI`and,

`AI v/s AI` modes of game-play
